      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently a Director of Operations, looking to make a career change into Software Development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in to SW suburbs of Chicago: Burbank, IL & Plainfield, IL</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy hiking, spinning, traveling, live music, and hanging out with family and friends</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would say being a Chef or Sommelier</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently living in Denver, CO...for now</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've looked back on the last ten years, and had many moments of introspection that has helped me realize what I want out of the next phase of my career. 
        I'm interested in becoming a web developer not only to learn a new skill and in turn become more marketable, but I am overall a very pragmatic and logical person. 
        I think this career path will lend itself better to my personality type. </p>
